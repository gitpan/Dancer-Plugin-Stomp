NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::Stomp - A Dancer plugin for talking to Stomp message
    brokers.

VERSION
    version 0.0001

SYNOPSIS
        use Dancer;
        use Dancer::Plugin::Stomp;

        post '/messages' => sub {
            stomp->send({ destination => '/queue/foo', body => request->body });
        };

        dance;

DESCRIPTION
    This module aims to make it as easy as possible to interact with a Stomp
    message broker. It provides one new keyword, stomp, which returns a
    Net::Stomp object.

CONFIGURATION
    Configuration requires a hostname at a minimum.

        plugins:
          Stomp:
            foo:
              hostname: foo.com

    The above configuration will allow you to send a message very simply:

        stomp->send({ destination => '/queue/foo', body => 'hello' });

    Multiple Stomp clients can also be configured:

        plugins:
          Stomp:
            foo:
              hostname: foo.com
            bar:
              hostname: bar.com
              port: 61613
              login: bob
              passcode: secret
              auto_connect: 0

    To distinguish between multiple stomp clients, you call stomp with a
    name:

        stomp('foo')->send( ... );
        stomp('bar')->send( ... );

    The available configuration options for a given Stomp client are:

    hostname - Required
    port - Optional, Default: 61613
    login - Optional
    passcode - Optional
    auto_connect - Optional, Default: 1
