NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::Stomp - A Dancer plugin for talking to STOMP message
    brokers.

VERSION
    version 1.0000

SYNOPSIS
        use Dancer;
        use Dancer::Plugin::Stomp;

        post '/messages' => sub {
            stomp->send(destination => '/queue/foo', body => request->body);
        };

        dance;

DESCRIPTION
    This module aims to make it as easy as possible to interact with a STOMP
    message broker. It provides one new keyword, stomp, which returns a
    Net::STOMP::Client object.

CONFIGURATION
    Configuration requires a host at a minimum.

        plugins:
          Stomp:
            default:
              host: foo.com

    The above configuration will allow you to send a message very simply:

        stomp->send(destination => '/queue/foo', body => 'hello');

    Multiple clients can also be configured:

        plugins:
          Stomp:
            default:
              host: foo.com
            bar:
              host: bar.com
              port: 61613
              login: bob
              passcode: secret
              auto_connect: 0

    To distinguish between multiple stomp clients, you call stomp with a
    name:

        stomp('default')->send( ... );
        stomp('bar')->send( ... );

    The available configuration options for a client are:

    host - Required
    port - Optional, Default: 61613
    login - Optional
    passcode - Optional
    auto_connect - Optional, Default: 1
